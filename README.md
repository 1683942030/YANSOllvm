# YANSOllvm
Yet Another Not So Obfuscated LLVM

# LLVM Version
Based on the release version [9.0.1](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-9.0.1). Other version might work as well, but one has to merge/rebase the X86 related code.

# How to Build/Compile/Use
Just wait in front of your screen. The code will compile itself somehow.

# Warrant
No warrant. Only bugs. Do not use.

# License
**Partial** code of ```Flattening.cpp``` comes from the original [OLLVM](https://github.com/obfuscator-llvm/obfuscator/tree/llvm-4.0) project, which is released under the University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License.

**Partial** code of ```ObfuscateZero.cpp``` comes from the [Quarkslab/llvm-passes](https://github.com/quarkslab/llvm-passes), which is released under the MIT License.

Besides, the X86 related code is modified directly from the [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-9.0.1), which is released under the Apache-2.0 WITH LLVM-exception License.

All other files are my own work.

The whole project is released under GPLv3 which is surely compatible with all above licenses.
