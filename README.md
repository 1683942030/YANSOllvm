# YANSOllvm
Yet Another Not So Obfuscated LLVM

# LLVM Version
Based on the release version [9.0.1](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-9.0.1). Other version might work as well, but one has to merge/rebase the X86 related code.

# How to Build/Compile/Use
Just wait in front of your screen. The code will compile itself somehow.

# Warrant
No warrant. Only bugs. Do not use.
